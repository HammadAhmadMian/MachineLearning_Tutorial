## Description  
This tutorial explains **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** with a focus on the **role and working of hidden states in RNNs**.  
- Covers the fundamentals of RNN architecture, forward propagation, and backpropagation through time (BPTT).  
- Breaks down how hidden states retain sequential information and enable temporal dependencies.  
- Includes visualizations, equations, and code examples (Python) for hands-on learning.  

**Target Audience**: Students or beginners familiar with basic neural networks.  

**Tools/Software**:  
- Python 3.x  
- NumPy, Matplotlib  
- Deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch/TensorFlow)  
- Google Colab

## How to Use This Tutorial  
1. **Download the PDF**: Open it with a PDF reader (e.g., Adobe Acrobat).  
2. **Navigation**:  
   - Use the **clickable table of contents** (page X) to jump to sections like "Examples" or "Role of Hidden States".  
3. **Code Examples**:  
   - Code snippets demonstrate hidden state changes.   
4. **Figures & Equations**:  
   - Diagrams illustrate hidden state flow across time steps.  
   - Equations use LaTeX notation (e.g., \( h_t = f(Wx_t + Uh_{t-1} + b) \)).

## Troubleshooting  
- **Code not working?** Check library versions (e.g., TensorFlow 2.x vs 1.x).  
- **Confused by hidden state equations?** Review the "RNN Basics" section or prerequisite linear algebra.  
- **PDF rendering issues?** Ensure your reader supports embedded equations/diagrams.
